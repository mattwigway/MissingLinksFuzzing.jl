This repository contains "fuzzing" tests for [MissingLinks.jl](https://github.com/mattwigway/MissingLinks.jl). It generates random but semi-realistic street networks, then checks that MissingLinks handles them as expected. Street network generation is a modified version of the minimum-spanning-tree algorithm [discussed here](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/9d85bv/comment/e5gtjl3/), with some additions so that the network both has cycles and is not completely connected, to better represent the pedestrian experience.
